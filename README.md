# Physics-Calculator-with-Tkinter
This Python program is a GUI-based Physics Calculator built with the tkinter library. It provides an interactive interface for performing calculations based on three fundamental physics laws:

Ohm’s Law: 𝑉=𝐼×𝑅
V=I×R
Ampère’s Law: 𝐵=𝜇×𝐼2𝜋𝑟

Faraday’s Law: 𝐸=−ΔΦΔ𝑡

The program uses a tab-based layout through ttk.Notebook, with each tab corresponding to one of these laws. Users can enter known values into input fields, and the system calculates unknown parameters.
It also includes a number pad for input, a reset function, and error handling for invalid or zero values.
